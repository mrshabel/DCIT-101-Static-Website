                <p>Waking up to see the sun is always a blessing at first sight. Life seems promising based on the happenings around me.
                <br>Growing up as a child, I had intentions of being in a virtual space, and being able to manipulate things which aren't physical.
                <br>Although I have been reluctant on this dream, I feel that one day things will definitely work out for me.
                <br>Hopefully, I'd get a space in the MetaVerse to experience the greatness Technology has on us, Humans.
